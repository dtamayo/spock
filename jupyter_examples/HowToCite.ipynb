      "This paper made use of stability predictions from the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package \\citep{spock}. Collisional evolution was simulated with the GiantImpactPhaseEmulator \\citep{giantimpact}, repeatedly using the DeepRegressor (a Bayesian neural network) to predict the time to the next dynamical instability \\citep{deepregressor}, and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to predict the collisional outcome \\citep{giantimpact}.\n",
